Rules for the Git workflow:

- Only one person can write to the MASTER copy per day. They are the MASTER Keyholder (may get a physical signifier for this person).
- Only DEFINITELY FINISHED and peer-reviewed changes can be merged onto MASTER.


Steps for Developers:

1. Make sure to grab the new copy of MASTER in the morning and copy it into your own personal folder.
2. Closely document your changes in a seperate .txt file as you develop.
3. Test and peer-review regularly to make sure only finished changes are merged onto MASTER.
4. When you have any changes to make, give them to the MASTER keyholder BEFORE 3:30-ish PM.

Steps for the MASTER keyholder:

1. During the day, put all changed files gathered from people into a separate well-labeled folder. Make sure to mark with person who changed it and change they made.
2. At around 3:30 PM (loosely) these changed files will be manually merged into a copy of the MASTER copy, now labelled DEVELOP.
3. DEVELOP will be avaliable to check through for all other developersfor a little while (probably just show it to them or tell them it's avaliable)
4. The next morning, DEVELOP will then be pushed to Github using either Annabel's Laptop or The Mac.
5. MASTER will then be either archived somewhere or deleted, and DEVELOp shall be renamed MASTER.
