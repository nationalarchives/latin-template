						<h2>First Declension Nouns</h2>
						<p>Here you can see some examples of Latin nouns from the first declension:</p>

						<p>Notice anything similar about them?</p>
						<p>Nouns that end in ‘a’ belong to the <strong>first declension</strong>; They are mostly <strong>feminine</strong>.</p>
						<p>People’s names are also nouns. In Latin, women’s names often end in ‘a’ (example: Maria to Mary).</p>

						<p>All Latin nouns have a gender – they are either masculine, feminine or neuter. Even charters and parishes have a gender! </p>
						<p>In English we give some nouns a gender, for example we describe ships as ‘she’.</p>

						<p>The first part of a noun stays the same, but endings are added to give different meanings. Below is an example using <em>carta</em>:</p>

								<tr>
									<th>Singular</th>
									<th>Meaning</th> 
									<th>Plural</th>
								</tr>

								<tr>
									<td><em>cart<strong>a</strong></em></td>
									<td>
										<p>charter(s)</p>
										<p>Subject of the sentence: A charter costs 2 pounds.</p>
									</td>
									<td><em>cart<strong>e</strong></em></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><em>cart<strong>a<strong></em></td>
									<td>
										<p>Oh charter(s)!</p>
									</td>
									<td><em>cart<strong>e<strong></em></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><em>cart<strong>am<strong></em></td>
									<td>
										<p>charter(s)</p>
										<p>Object of the sentence: The king grants the charter.</p>
									</td>
									<td><em>cart<strong>as<strong></em></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><em>cart<strong>e<strong></em></td>
									<td>
										<p>of the charter(s)</p>
										<p>The seal of the charters is broken.</p>
									</td>
									<td><em>cart<strong>arum<strong></em></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><em>cart<strong>e<strong></em></td>
									<td>
										<p>to or for the charter(s)</p>
										<p>They refer to the charters.</p>
									</td>
									<td><em>cart<strong>is<strong></em></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><em>cart<strong>a<strong></em></td>
									<td>
										<p>by, with, or from the charter(s)</p>
										<p>He claims the land by a charter.</p>
									</td>
									<td><em>cart<strong>is<strong></em></td>
								</tr>

						<p>The ending of a noun is <strong>crucial</strong>, as it tells you: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Whether the noun is singular or plural</li>
							<li>What role the noun is playing in the sentence.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Read through our example of <em>carta</em> again. Can you see that some endings are the same, but have different meanings? For example, <em>carte</em> can mean:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Charters</li>
							<li>Of the charter</li>
							<li>To or for the charter</li>
						</ul>
						<p>To decide which meaning is appropriate, one can read the rest of the sentence and infer from there. For example, if part of a sentence is ‘she asked the king’ and the remaining word is carte, the meaning of carte that would make sense is ‘for the charter’.</p>
						<p>All first declension nouns take the same endings as carta <strong>except</strong> for <em>anima</em> (soul) and <em>filia</em> (daughter); Instead <em>animabus</em> means ‘to or for the souls’ and ‘by, with or from the souls’, and <em>filiabus</em> means ‘to or for the daughters’ and ‘by, with or from the daughters’</p>
						<p>A few first declension nouns are masculine. You are only really likely to come across these three masculine first declension nouns: </p>
